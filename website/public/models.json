The sales are regulated by means of contracts with the airline companies, whereby a single contract may consist of several acquisitions of airplanes. The global contract stipulates common elements across all acquisitions such as delivery conditions, legal aspects, etc. Each acquisition of an airplane has further specific details, such as the chosen model of airplane, the negotiated price for that airplane, chosen options & customizations, delivery date, etc. Each contract is managed by a Boeing salesperson. An employee can act as salesperson for several contracts. Given the long term of contracts, the assigned salesperson may change over time, but Boeing ensures there is always a salesperson available for the client. \r\nSome airlines are related to each other: for example, main airlines often have a low cost daughter airline company. Boeing therefore keep track as much as possible of the mother-daughter relationships between airline companies, to be able to track whether to sold aircrafts are shifted to partner airlines of the original buyer.\r\n",

During registration, the system checks the user name for uniqueness and the correct email address by sending a confirmation link. In the meantime, the user is set up for the web portal by an administrator. Once these processes have been completed, users are automatically informed by email that they have been activated and can log in accordingly.

Being economists, they are unaware of the specificities of databases and have therefore asked you to create a UML class diagram.\r\nA large number of songs will be made available through their website, and the following information on each song needs to be stored: title, year, length, and genre. Also, artist information will be added, including date of birth, name and a URL to a website (e.g., Wikipedia page) with additional information on the artist. You can assume an artist is uniquely identified by his/her name, and that a song always belongs to exactly one artist. The Musicmatic students also point out that songs having the same title are possible, and only the combination of song and artist can be assumed to be unique.\r\nThe database will also have to store information on the people using Musicmatic. It was decided to only discriminate between two types of users: the regular users who will be able to buy music, and the business users who will deliver the content (upload the music). The following information is recorded on each user: (unique) ID, name, and address. Business users will also have a VAT number. The students want to offer a flexible service, and decided business users can only upload individual songs. These songs are classified either as singles or hits, and regular users can directly buy the singles. Otherwise, people can compose an album consisting of multiple hits (no singles). The position of each hit in the album is stored as a track number in the database. Note that the album of regular users can be turned into a suggestion to other regular users with similar purchasing behavior. \r\nFinally, a users can be regular user on some occasions (e.g., when downloading a single or album), and a business user at other times (e.g., when uploading self-made songs to Musicmatic).",

    "description": "One of your (hipster) acquaintances thinks he has the next billion-dollar startup idea for an app: Pizza Delivery with Entertainment. He heard from other people that you are following the course on database management, and asks you to design the UML class diagram. Afterwards, he will use the UML class diagram to ask programmers to implement the app.\r\nHe explains the basic functionality of the app as follows: customers can order pizzas from restaurants to be delivered to a specific address, and if they want to, they can choose a special “entertainment order”. When an order is an entertainment order, the delivery person stays with the customer after delivering the pizza and entertains the customers (e.g., by singing, making jokes, doing magic tricks, etc.) for a certain amount of time.\r\nNew follows a detailed explanation of the range of capabilities of the app: when people create an account for the app and become app users, they have to indicate their birthday and fill in their name and address. Every user should also be uniquely identifiable.\r\nOnce the account is created, the users should be presented with three options: the first option in the app is to select “business owner”. Of these business owners, we also ask them to provide their LinkedIn account so we can add them to our profession network. Every business owner can own a number of pizza restaurants. Of these pizza restaurants, we want to register the zip code, address, phone number, website, and the opening hours.\r\nEach pizza restaurant can offer a number of pizzas. Of those pizzas, we want to keep the name (margarita, quattro stagioni, etc.), the crust structure (for example, classic Italian crust, deep dish crust, cheese crust), and the price. While two pizzas from different pizza restaurants may have the same name, they will not be exactly the same as the taste will be different, and thus should be considered unique. Moreover, pizzas should be distinguishable even if they have the same price, e.g., a pizza margarita from Pizza Pronto in New York which costs $12 must be distinguishable from a pizza margarita from Pizza Rapido in Singapore, which also costs $12.\r\nThe second option in the app is to select “hungry customer”. For these hungry customers, we need a delivery address. Hungry customers can make orders for pizzas. Each order gets assigned an ID, and we want our app to log the date and time when the order was placed. We also allow the hungry customer to indicate the latest time of delivery, and ask how many people the order is for. An order can be for one or more pizzas.\r\nAlso, a special type of order can be made: the entertainment order. Not every order has to be an entertainment order. But when a hungry customer indicates that he or she wants to be entertained while eating the pizza, we not only want to register all the regular order information, but also the type of entertainment the user requests, and for how long (a duration).\r\nThe third option in the app to select is that of “entertainer”. When users select entertainer, they need to provide a stage name, write a short bio about themselves, and indicate their price per 30 minutes. Every entertainment order is fulfilled by exactly one entertainer. Every entertainer can choose for which pizza restaurant(s) he/she wants to work. For each pizza restaurant an entertainer wants to work with, he/she should indicate his/her availability by day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.).",

    "description": "100% Driven by technology\r\nSober is new taxi company deploying self-driving cars to provide cap services. Although it operates its own fleet of self-driving cabs, people can also register their cars as Sober cabs and have them provide taxi services whenever they are not using their cars. For the latter, Sober also wants to keep track of the car owners.\r\nSober offers two types of taxi services: ride-hailing and ride-sharing. Ride-hailing is a service whereby customers can hail a taxi so they can be picked up and driven to their destination for a time-and distance-based fee. The hailing is an immediate, on-demand service and requests can be made with the Sober App. With just one tap on the screen, a customer can request a cab from anywhere, receive an estimated wait time, and a notification when the car has arrived. Besides the Sober App, users can also hail Sober cabs by hand-waving them as they see them pass, in which case Sober’s deep-learning based image recognition system identifies the wave gesture as a cab request. For each use of the ride-hail service, Sober wants to store the time of pick-up and drop-off, the location of pick-up and drop-off, the ride duration, the distance, the number of passengers, the fee, the type of request (via Sober App or hand-waving) and the number and name of the lead customer (the one who pays). The maximum number of passengers for a ride-hail service is six. \r\nRide-sharing is another service offered by Sober, which requires more careful planning. It can also be referred to as carpooling and aims at reducing costs, traffic congestion, and the carbon footprint.  Because of the planning, both Sober and its customers can negotiate the fee whereby more customers per cab means a lower fee per customer (flexible pricing). To provide an eco-friendly incentive, Sober pledges to plant a tree for each customer who books 20 uses of the Sober ride-sharing service. For each ride-share service, Sober wants to store the time of pick-up and drop-off, the location of pick-up and drop-off, the ride duration, the distance, the number and names of all customers, and the upfront negotiated fee. The maximum number of passengers for a ride-share service is ten.\r\nDue to the novelty of the self-driving car technology, accidents cannot be 100% ruled out. Sober also wants to store information about accident dates, location, and damage amounts per car.",

I need to be able to store their names and social security numbers. Planners and administrative staff should be able to log into the system with a username and password.

Of course, it can happen that a vehicle needs to be repaired or inspected. For this purpose, I want to store the repair shop (name and address are known), the employee who took the vehicle to the repair shop, and the duration and cost of the repair.\r\nOrders can be assigned to each driver. Usually, a customer calls and tells us when they need a transport vehicle and how big the package is. Based on this, the planner knows which type of vehicle is needed for the order. I always want to know which planner has assigned an order to a vehicle. It must also be possible to save a comment with additional information about the order, and I need to know when the driver starts and finishes the order. It is also important that I always know which driver has completed which order with which vehicle.

In the first 5 tasks of this exam you will produce a specification step-by-step.\nShort description:\nInfrastructure and software platform for capturing energy consumption data in private homes.\nThe customer:\nHomeTec is a small company in the domain of building engineering which manufactures sensors which can be installed in private homes. The company is, same as your company, located in Aachen. \nDetailed system description:\nThe system “E-Home-2020” consists of a set of multiple sensors, which report their values to a connected SensorController. Furthermore, the SensorController stores information about the apartment with its inhabitants. The apartment’s inhabitants can log on to the SensorController by using their username and password and query values for each installed sensor. Moreover, they can specify a threshold for each sensor. An external System called „E-Monitor“  is attached to the system and checks all thresholds for each sensor automatically. If the sensor’s threshold is exceeded and if an email address has been specified for the apartment, “E-Monitor” will send alert messages via the “E-Home-2020” system. \nSome inhabitants have administrative rights which enable them to configure sensors. This includes assigning sensors to a new room or changing the sensor’s description.\nAt the moment, the company HomeTec manufactures two types of sensors: temperature sensors and power sensors (the latter are installed in a plug-and-play fashion between the power-socket and the respective appliance). Temperature sensors have a valid value range (min , max). Power sensors store the total power consumption as counter reading. All sensors have a unique vendor-id, a description (e.g. “temperature radiator living room” or “power consumption microwave oven”) and a unit. Possible units are CELSIUS and WATT. Each sensor is assigned to exactly one room. An apartment has an address and consists of at least two rooms. Rooms have a description (e.g. „living room“). For each sensor one can query the respective measured values, which are stored in the system. Each value has a timestamp and the corresponding value as a floating point number. For quick access one can access the last value of a sensor directly.\nGoal of project:\nThe goal of the project is the development of a prototype, which works on a specific target platform in a specific environment and provides essential functionality.\n",
